# Barclay Lab GitHub Organization

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the Barclay Lab at the University of Calgary!

## Overview

This repository is organized to facilitate collaboration and version control for the diverse code bases, tools, and GUIs used in experiments conducted by the Barclay Lab. The structure is designed to enhance clarity, accessibility, and efficiency in managing the lab's computational resources.

## Repository Structure

The organization is divided into several key directories:

- **Experiments:** Contains subdirectories for each experiment, including code, data, and results. The code directory further organizes by tools, and a common directory for code shared across tools. 

- **Tools:** Organized by individual tools used in the lab, with subdirectories for different versions containing source code and documentation.

- **GUIs:** Similar to the Tools directory, this section organizes GUIs by versions, providing source code and documentation.

- **Shared:** Contains common resources such as libraries and scripts. The Libraries directory has subdirectories for each library, and the Scripts directory organizes different types of scripts.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the organization, consider the following steps:

1. **Clone Repositories:** Clone the specific repositories relevant to your work using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BarclayLab/<repository-name>.git

2. **Contributing:** If you want to contribute to a repository, please follow the guidelines outlined in the respective repository's README file.

3. **Issues and Discussions:** Use the "Issues" tab for bug reports, feature requests, or general discussions. Engage with other lab members through the "Discussions" tab.
